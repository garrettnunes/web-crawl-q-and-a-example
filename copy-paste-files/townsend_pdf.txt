iiPREFACE
The City of Townsend Municipal Code contains the codification and
revision of the ordinances of the City of Townsend, Tennessee.  By referring tothe historical citation appearing at the end of each section, the user candetermine the origin of each particular section.  The absence of a historicalcitation means that the section was added by the codifier.  The word "modified"in the historical citation indicates significant modification of the originalordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections.  Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title.  Each section numberis complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, andthe section of the chapter of which it is a part.  Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number.  The second digit identifies thechapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number.  Forexample, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as ยง 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents, code index and the analysis preceding
each title and chapter of the code, together with the cross references andexplanations included as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions inthe code relating to any question that might arise.  However, the user shouldnote that most of the administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, ZoningMap Amendments, Tax Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code.  Likewise,ordinances that have been passed since the last update of the code do not appearhere.  Therefore, the user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the cityrecorder for a comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date.  MTAS will provide updating service under the followingconditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deletingspecific chapters or sections of the code (see section 7 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
(3) That the city agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in the
MTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.
iiiWhen the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by suchordinances.  This service will be performed at least annually and more often ifjustified by the volume of amendments.  Replacement pages will be suppliedwith detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the codecomplete and up to date.
The able assistance of the codes team: Kelley Myers and Nancy Gibson
is gratefully acknowledged.

approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection,
except when directed to proceed by a police officer or traffic control signal.
15-505. At "yield" signs .  (1)  The driver of a vehicle who is faced with
a yield sign at the entrance to a throug h highway or other public roadway is not

is clear.
(2) Where there is provided more than  one (1) lane for vehicular traffic
entering a through highway or other public  roadway, if one (1) or more lanes at
such entrance are designated a yield lane  by an appropriate marker, this section
shall control the movement of traffic in any lane so marked with a yield sign,even though traffic in other lanes may be controlled by an electrical signaldevice or other signs, signals, markings or controls.
15-506. At traffic control signals generally
.  Whenever traffic is
controlled by traffic control signals ex hibiting the words "Go," "Caution," or
"Stop," or exhibiting different colored lights successively one at a time, or with
arrows, the following colors only shall be used and the terms and lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(1) Green alone, or "Go" :
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight
through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either
such turn.  But vehicular traffic, incl uding vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjace nt crosswalk at the time such signal
is exhibited.
(b) Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the
roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.(2) Yellow alone, or "Caution," when shown following the green or "Go"
signal :
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the
red or "Stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and suchvehicular traffic shall not enter or be  crossing the intersection when the
red or "Stop" signal is exhibited.
(b) Pedestrians facing the signal are thereby advised that there
is insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian thenstarting to cross shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.  (3) Red alone, or "Stop"
:
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before15-16
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "Go"
is shown alone.  A right turn on a red signal shall be permitted at allintersections within the city, provid ed that the prospective turning car
shall come to a full and complete stop before turning and that the turning
car shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and cross traffic traveling
in  accordance with their traffic signal.  However, such turn will notendanger other traffic lawfully using th e intersection.  A right turn on red
shall be permitted at all intersections, except those that are clearlymarked by a "No Turns On Red" sign , which may be erected by the city
at intersections which the city decides require no right turns on red in the
interest of traffic safety.

intersections within the city where a one-way street intersects withanother one-way street moving in th e same direction into which the left
turn would be made from the original one-way street.  Before makingsuch a turn, the prospective turning car shall come to a full and complete
stop and shall yield the right-of-w ay to pedestrians and cross traffic
traveling in accordance with the tr affic signal so as not to endanger
traffic lawfully using the intersection.  A left turn on red shall bepermitted at any applicable intersecti on except that clearly marked by a
"No Turn of Red" sign, which may be er ected by the city at intersections
which the city decides requires no le ft turns on red in the interest of
traffic safety.
(d) The driver of a motorcycle a pproaching an intersection that
is controlled by a traffic-control sign al utilizing a vehicle detection device
that is inoperative due to the size of the motorcycle shall come to a fulland complete stop at the intersection  and, after exerci sing due care as
provided by law, may proceed with due caution when it is safe to do so.
It is not a defense to ยง 15-506, "At tr affic control signals generally," that
the driver of a motorcycle proceeded under the belief that a traffic-controlsignal utilized a vehicle detection device or was inoperative due to thesize of the motorcycle when such sign al did not utilize a vehicle detection
device or that any such device was no t in fact inoperative due to the size
of the motorcycle.(4) Steady red with green arrow
:
(a) Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the move ment indicated by  such arrow but
shall yield the right-of-way to pede strians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.15-17
(b) No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway
unless such entry can be made safely  and without interfering with any
vehicular traffic.(5) In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an inte rsection, the provisions of this section
shall be applicable except as to those pr ovisions which by their nature can have
no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on thepavement indicating where the stop sha ll be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

before entering the nearest crosswalk at  an intersection or at a limit line
when marked, or, if none, then before  entering the intersection, and the
right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
(b) Flashing yellow (caution signal) .  When a yellow lens is
illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles mayproceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.(2) This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings.  Conduct
of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed bythe rules set forth in ยง 15-504 of this code.
15-508. At pedestrian-control signals
. Wherever special pedestrian-
control signals exhibiting the words "Wal k" or "Wait" or "Don't Walk" have been
placed or erected by the municipality, such signals shall apply as follows:

in the direction of such signal, but an y pedestrian who has partially completed
